#' Featherston (1971). The weight of Taenia hydatigena tapeworms fed to dogs and the weight of the scoleces recovered from the dogs after 20 days. (A scolex is the attachment end of a tapeworm, consisting of the head and neck). The cysticerci used in the experiment were collected from sheep carcasses and force-fed to 10 dogs via gelatine capsules. The scoleces were recovered from each dog at autopsy, 20 days after the introduction of the tapeworms. The table gives the mean weight of the initial cysticerci and the mean weight of the recovered worms for each of the 10 dogs in the study.
